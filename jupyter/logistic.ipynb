    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Logistic regressions, also referred to as a logit models, are powerful alternatives to linear regressions that allow one to model a binary outcome (i.e., 0 or 1) and provide notably accurate predictions on the probability of said outcome occurring given an observation. The parameter estimates within logit models can provide insights into how different explanatory variables, or features, contribute to the model predictions. Many readers are likely familiar with interpreting logit model parameters in terms of **odds ratios** (if not don't worry, I briefly cover this below). Nevertheless, the interpretation of these parameters in terms of **probabilities** is not as straightforward, but a robust understanding of how to interpret these parameters can provide an immense amount of intuition into explaining the model's underlying predictive behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Making a prediction is extremely powerful, but intuitively explaining the predictive components of a model in real world terms can take your project analysis to the next level.\n",
    "\n",
    "By the end of this article you will see logistic regression in a new light and gain an understanding of how to explain the model parameters with a staggering amount of intuition. This article assumes a brief underlying knowledge of logit models and thus directs focus more intently on interpreting the model parameters in a comprehensible manner. Nevertheless, we will first briefly discuss the theory behind logit models. We will then give an in-depth discussion into how to interpret the model parameters as marginal effects. Lastly, we will cover a practical example predicting fraudulent credit card transactions utilizing the following [Kaggle dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/dhanushnarayananr/credit-card-fraud?resource=download).\n",

    "## Logistic Regression Crash Course\n",
    "\n",
    "[Logit Models](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logistic_regression) belong to a more broad family of [generalized linear models](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generalized_linear_model) (GLMs) that, in brief, allow for flexible fitting of linear models when the outcome of interest follows a different underlying distribution than gaussian and relates the linear model to the outcome of interest via a link function. The canonical linear regression is a special case where the link function is the identity function. In the binary outcome case, a linear regression, which is referred to as linear probability model, can provide predictions that are less than 0 or greater than 1 (See Figure 1). This clearly poses issues as probabilities are naturally bounded between 0 and 1. However, GLM's provide a convenient framework to solve this problem!\n",
    "\n",
    "The logit model is a specific case that allows for the modeling of binary outcomes that follow a [Bernoulli distribution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bernoulli_distribution). The logit model is particularly attractive because the link function used (logit function) is bounded between 0 and 1. And consequently, all model predictions are bounded between 0 and 1, as anticipated in the probability space. Figure 1 below provides a nice visual comparison between the model fits of linear probability model and logistic regression in a bivariate case."

    "## Interpreting Logit Parameters as Marginal Effects\n",
    "\n",
    "A marginal effect can be thought of as the average (or marginal) effect on the outcome (or target) variable resulting from a change in the explanatory variable (or feature) of interest. This can similarly be conceptualized as follows: At the average (or marginal) observation/individual, what is the effect of changing an explanatory variable on the outcome. In our case with a binary variable, this would be akin to estimating the average effect of changing an explanatory variable on the probability of observing the outcome.\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Caution:** Marginal effects must be interpreted only as an association and not as a causal relationship. Causality requires additional identifying assumptions.\n",
    "\n",
    "By recognizing that the marginal effect is simply a rate of change, one may immediately notice that this boils down to a taking a derivative with respect to the explanatory variable. We will first start with the simple linear regression case to make things easy. Suppose we have the following linear regression:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "y_i= X_i \\mathbf{\\beta} + \\epsilon_i =\\beta_0+\\beta_1x_{1i}+\\beta_2x_{2i}+ \\dots + \\beta_kx_{ki}+\\epsilon_i\n",
    "\\tag{3}\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to find the marginal effect of any variable, we can take the derivative with respect to the $x$ of interest in (3). This derivative for any $x^*$ is simply:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "\\frac{\\partial y_i}{\\partial x^*}=\\beta^*\n",
    "\\tag{4}\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Note, in this case, we have a constant marginal effect, which makes sense because a linear regression is a linear projection of y onto X. The marginal effect can be interpreted as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Interpretation**: On average, a one unit increase in $x^*$ is associated with a $β^*$ change in $y$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now the careful reader may notice that this derivative is not nearly as trivial for logit models (See below for a discussion into log-odds and odds ratios). Consider the logistic model outlined in eq. (1). The derivative with respect to any x* can be solved for using the chain and quotient rules. We can thus find the marginal effect of $x^*$ on the probability of $y$ occurring as follows:\n",

I will leave this for the interested reader and the code provided in the next section can be readily augmented to do so (i.e., plug in the values of each variable you are interested into (5) to obtain the marginal effect at that observation). This can provide **very powerful** insights into how the predictive parameter marginal effects vary by certain types of individuals/observations!\n",

    "## OPTIONAL: Nonlinearities & Interactions\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose we had the two following beliefs: $x^*$ has a quadratic relationship with $y$ and we believe the effect to differ by gender. We can augment our logit model to include two additional engineered features as follows:\n",

    "I hope this post has helped you learn how to extract **meaningful insights** from logit model parameters. It is clear that marginal effect interpretations in terms of probabilities provide an immense amount of intuition and explainability of the predictive mechanics under a logit model framework. Generally speaking, these parameters explain how the model makes predictions as well as explain associations between the target and features. However, under additional identifying assumptions, we can make more powerful statements towards interpreting model parameters as a causal relationship between certain features and targets. I hope this post has increased your knowledge and appreciation for logistic regressions!\n",

My posts primarily explore real-world and theoretical applications of econometric and statistical/machine learning techniques, but also whatever I am currently interested in or learning 😁. At the end of the day, I write to learn! I hope to make complex topics slightly more accessible to all.\n",
