    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Applied econometrics is generally interested in establishing causality. That is, what is the “treatment” effect of $T$ on some outcome $y$. In a simple bivariate case, we can imagine randomly assigning treatment $T=1$ to some individuals and $T=0$ to others. This can be represented by the following linear regression model:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "y_i = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1T_i+\\epsilon_i\n",
    "\\tag{1}\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "If we assume the treatment is truly randomly assigned, then $T$ is independent to the error term or, in the economists jargon, exogenous. Therefore, we can estimate eq. (1) using ordinary least squares (OLS) and interpret the coefficient estimate on $T$ with a causal interpretation - the average treatment effect (ATE):\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "\\text{ATE}=\\mathbb{E_n}[y(T=1)-y(T=0)]=\\mathbb{E}[(\\beta_0+\\beta_1)-\\beta_0]=\\beta_1\n",
    "\\tag{2}\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "However, when we are dealing with non-experimental data, it is almost always the case that the treatment of interest is not independent to the error term or, again in the economists jargon, endogenous. For example, suppose we were interested in identifying the treatment effect of time spent reading books as a child on an individuals future educational attainment. Without any random assignment of time spent reading as a child, estimating a naïve linear regression, as in eq. (1), will fail to capture a large set of additional factors that may drive individual time spent reading books and educational attainment (i.e., socioeconomic status, parents education, underlying ability, other hobbies, etc.). Thus, when dealing with non-experimental data, we must rely on controlling for additional covariates and then make an argument that treatment is now \"as good as randomly assigned\" to establish causality. This is known as the conditional independence assumption (CIA). In our educational example above, we can reframe eq. (1) as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "\\text{Education}_i=\\beta_0+\\beta_1\\text{Read}_i+\\mathbf{X}_i \\Phi + \\epsilon_i\n",
    "\\tag{3}\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where we now control for a set of observed covariates $X$. The key estimate of interest on Read takes on a causal interpretation if and only if the CIA holds. That is, time spent reading is exogenous (i.e., no uncontrolled confounders) conditional on $X$. Equivalently,\n",

    "\\tag{4}\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Without the CIA, our coefficient estimates are biased and we are limited in what we can say in terms of causality. Realistically, it is often quite difficult to make the argument for the CIA and, unfortunately, this assumption is not directly testable. In fact, what I have discussed above is a fundamental motivator for an entire field of econometrics that is devoted to establishing, developing, and implementing quasi-experimental research designs to establish causality including, but most definitely not limited to, difference-in-differences, synthetic control, and instrumental variable designs. These quasi-experimental designs seek to exploit exogenous (\"as good as random\") sources of variation in a treatment of interest $T$ to study the causal effect of $T$ on some outcome(s) $y$. There are some excellent econometric texts that are accessible to those with little to no background in econometrics, including \"The Effect\" by Nick Huntington-Klein, \"Causal Inference: The Mixtape\" by Scott Cunningham, or \"Causal Inference for the Brave and True\" by Matheus Facure Alves.[1][2][3] Joshua Angrist and Jörn-Steffen Pischke provide a deeper dive in \"Mostly Harmless Econometrics\" for those interested.[4]\n",
    "\n",
    "Despite the fact that establishing the CIA is particularly difficult through controlling for covariates alone, there is a substantial theorem in econometrics that provides some very powerful intuition into what it really means to \"control\" for additional covariates. Ultimately, this not only provides a deeper understanding to the underlying mechanisms of a linear regression, but also how to conceptualize key relationships of interest (i.e., the effect of $T$ on $Y$).\n",
    "\n",
    "> Note that I have (intentionally) glossed over some additional causal inference/econometric assumptions, such as Positivity/Common Support & SUTVA/Counterfactual Consistency. In general, the CIA/Ignorability assumption is the most common assumption that needs to be defended. However, it is recommended that the interested reader familiarize themselves with the additional assumptuons. In brief, Positivity ensures we have non-treated households that are\n",
    "similar & comparable to treated households to enable counterfactual estimation & SUTVA ensures there is no\n",

    "In the 19th century, econometricians Ragnar Frisch and Frederick V. Waugh developed, which was later generalized by Michael C. Lovell, a ~super cool~ theorem (the FWL Theorem) that allows for the estimation of any key parameter(s) in a linear regression where one first \"partials out\" the effects of the additional covariates.[5][6] First, a quick refresher on linear regression will be helpful.\n",

(3); that is, the effect of days per month spent reading as a child on educational attainment. Recall that in order to make a causal statement about our estimate, we must satisfy the CIA. Thus, we can control for a set of additional covariates X and then estimate (3) directly using the OLS estimator derived in (7). However, the FWL Theorem allows us to obtain the exact same key parameter estimate on Read under the following 3-step procedure:\n",

    "Intuitively, the FWL theorem partials out the variation in Read (the treatment/variable of interest) and Education (the outcome of interest) that is explained by the additional covariates, and then uses the remaining variation to explain the key relationship of interest. This procedure can be generalized for any number of key variables of interest. For a more formal proof of this theorem, refer to [7]. The FWL theorem has been in the spotlight recently as the theoretical underpinning for debiased/orthogonal machine learning where steps 1 and 2 are conducted using machine learning algorithms rather than OLS. There are very cool developments occurring that are bridging the gaps between econometrics and machine learning, and I hope to have future posts with some cool applications with respect to some of these new methods. However, part 2 of Matheus Facure Alves' \"Causal Inference for the Brave and True\" is a great place to start.\n",

    "FWL provides a powerful mechanism by which to visualize the relationship between an outcome and treatment after one partials out the effects from additional covariates. In fact, FWL can be used to study the relationship between any two variables and the role covariates play in explaining their underlying relationship. I recommend trying it out on a dataset where you are interested in the relationship between two variables, and the role of additional covariates in confounding that relationship!\n",
