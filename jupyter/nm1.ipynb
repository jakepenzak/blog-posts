Then, in <a href=\"/articles/nm2\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">pt.  2</a>, we will be extending this theory to constrained optimization problems.

    "Mathematical optimization is an extremely powerful field of mathematics the underpins much of what we, as data scientists, implicitly, or explicitly, utilize on a regular basis — in fact, nearly all machine learning algorithms make use of optimization theory to obtain model convergence. Take, for example, a classification problem, we seek to minimize log-loss by choosing the optimal parameters or weights of the model. In general, mathematical optimization can be thought of as the primary theoretical mechanism by which machines learn. A robust understanding of mathematical optimization is an extremely beneficial skillset to have in the data scientists toolbox — it enables the data scientist to have a deeper understanding of many of the algorithms used today and, furthermore, to solve a vast array of unique optimization problems.\n",

    "Many of the readers may be familiar with gradient descent, or related optimization algorithms such as stochastic gradient descent. However, this post will discuss in more depth the classical Newton method for optimization, sometimes referred to as the Newton-Raphson method. Note that gradient descent, and it's various flavors, are overwhelmingly leveraged for many ML/AI algorithms due to it's efficiency & computationally tractability. We will, nevertheless, develop the mathematics behind optimization theory from the basics to gradient descent and then dive more into Newton’s method with implementations in python. This will serve as the necessary preliminaries for our excursion into constrained optimization in part 2 and an econometric profit-maximization problem in part 3 of this series.\n",

As you likely suspect, these methods tend to be much more computationally expensive than methods that utilize higher orders. Needless to say, they can be reliable and easy to program. There are methodologies out there that improve upon the simple grid-search, see [1] for more information; however, we will be focusing more-so on the higher-order schemes.\n",

In fact, gradient descent algorithms are primarily utilized for optimization of loss functions in Neural Networks and ML models, and many developments have improved the efficacy of these algorithms. Nevertheless, they are still using limited local information about the function (only the first derivative). Thus, in higher dimension and depending on the nature of the objective function & the learning rate, these schemes 1) can have a slow convergence rate as they maintain a linear convergence rate and 2) may fail entirely to converge.

    "There you have it! If you have made it up to this point, you now have a robust understanding of how to think about and abstractly formulate unconstrained mathematical optimization problems, along with the basic analytical approach and the more complex iterative methods for solving such problems. It is clear that the more information that we can incorporate about the function in the iterative schemes (i.e., higher order derivatives), the more efficient the convergence rate. _Note that we are just brushing the surface of the complex world that is mathematical optimization._ Nevertheless, the tools we have discussed today can absolutely be utilized in practice and extended to higher dimensional optimization problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "Stay tuned for Part 2 of this series where we will extend what we have learned here to solving constrained optimization problems — which is an extremely practical extension on unconstrained optimization. In fact, most real world optimization problems will have some form of constraints on the choice variables. Then we will shift to Part 3 of this series where we will apply the optimization theory learned and additional econometric & economic theory to solve a simple example of profit maximization problem. I hope you have enjoyed reading this as much as I have enjoyed writing it!\n",

    "## Bonus - The Pitfalls of Newton's Method\n",
    "\n",
    "Despite the attractiveness of Newton’s method, it is not without its own pitfalls. Notably, two main pitfalls exists — 1) NM is not always convergent even when choosing starting points near the solution & 2) NM requires the computation of the Hessian matrix at each step which can be computationally very expensive in higher dimensions. For pitfall #1), a respective solution is the Modified Newton method (MNM), which can be loosely thought of as gradient descent where the search direction is given by the Newton step, Δ. For pitfall #2), quasi-Newton methods, such as DFP or BFGS, have been proposed that approximate the inverse-Hessian used at each step to improve computational burden. For more information see, [1].\n",
