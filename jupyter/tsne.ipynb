    "## A Brief Introduction to t-SNE\n",
    "\n",
    "_t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding_ (t-SNE) is a dimensionality reduction tool that is primarily used in datasets with a large dimensional feature space and enables one to visualize the data down, or project it, into a lower dimensional space (usually 2-D). It is especially useful for visualizing non-linearly separable data wherein linear methods such as [Principal Component Analysis](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principal_component_analysis) (PCA) would fail. Generalizing linear frameworks of dimensionality reduction (such as PCA) into non-linear approaches (such as t-SNE) is also known as [Manifold Learning](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nonlinear_dimensionality_reduction). These methods can be extremely useful for visualizing and understanding the underlying structure of a high dimensional, non-linear data set, and can be great for disentangling and grouping together observations that are similar in the high-dimensional space. For more information on t-SNE and other manifold learning techniques, the [scikit-learn documentation](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/manifold.html) is a great resource. Additionally, to read about some cool areas t-SNE has seen applications, the [Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T-distributed_stochastic_neighbor_embedding#cite_note-3) highlights some of these areas with references to the work.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let’s start with breaking down the name _t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding_ into its components. t-SNE is an extension on stochastic neighbor embedding (SNE) presented 6 years earlier in this [paper](https://cs.nyu.edu/~roweis/papers/sne_final.pdf) by Geoffrey Hinton & Sam Roweis. So let’s start there. The _stochastic_ part of the name comes from the fact that the objective function is not convex and thus different results can arise from different initializations. The _neighbor embedding_ highlights the nature of the algorithm — optimally mapping the points in the original high-dimensional space into the corresponding low-dimensional space while best preserving the “neighborhood” structure of the points. SNE is comprised of the following (simplified) steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. _Obtain the Similarity Matrix between Points in the Original Space_: Compute the conditional probabilities for each datapoint $j$ relative to each datapoint $i$. These conditional probabilities are calculated in the original high-dimensional space using a Gaussian centered at $i$ and take on the following interpretation: the probability that i would pick $j$ as its neighbor in the original space. This creates a matrix that represents similarities between the points.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. _Initialization_: Choose random starting points in the lower-dimensional space (say, 2-D) for each datapoint in the original space and compute new conditional probabilities similarly as above in this new space.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. _Mapping_: Iteratively improve upon the points in the lower-dimensional space until the [Kullback-Leibler divergences](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kullback%E2%80%93Leibler_divergence) between all the conditional probabilities is minimized. Essentially we are minimizing the differences in the probabilities between the similarity matrices of the two spaces so as to ensure the similarities are best preserved in the mapping of the original high-dimensional dataset to the low-dimensional dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "t-SNE improves upon SNE in two primary ways:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. It minimizes the Kullback-Leibler divergences between the joint probabilities rather than the conditional probabilities. The authors refer to this as “symmetric SNE” b/c their approach ensures that the joint probabilities $p_ij$ = $p_ji$. **This results in a much better behaved cost function that is easier to optimize.**\n",
    "\n",
    "2. It computes the similarities between points using a [student's t-distribution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Student%27s_t-distribution) w/ one degree of freedom (also a [Cauchy Distribution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cauchy_distribution)) rather than a Gaussian in the low-dimensional space (step 2 above). Here we can see where the “t” in t-SNE is coming from. **This improvement helps to alleviate the “crowding problem” highlighted by the authors and to further improve the optimization problem.** This “crowding problem” can be envisioned as such: Imagine we have a 10-D space, the amount of space available in 2-D will not be sufficient to accurately capture those moderately dissimilar points compared to the amount of space for nearby points relative to the amount of space available in a 10-D space. More simply, just envision taking a 3-D space and projecting it down to 2-D, the 3-D space will have much more overall space to model the similarities relative to the projection down into 2-D. The Student-t distribution helps alleviate this problem by having heavier tails than the normal distribution. See the [original paper](https://jmlr.org/papers/volume9/vandermaaten08a/vandermaaten08a.pdf) for a much more in-depth treatment of this problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "If this did not all track immediately, that is okay! I am hoping when we implement this in code, the pieces will all fall in to place. The main takeaway is this: **t-SNE models similarities between datapoints in the high-dimensional space using joint probabilities of “datapoints choosing others as its neighbor”, and then tries to find the best mapping of these points down into the low-dimensional space, while best preserving the original high-dimensional similarities.**\n",
    "\n",
    "## Implementation from Scratch\n",
    "\n",
    "Let’s now move on to understanding t-SNE via implementing the original version of the algorithm as presented in the [paper](https://jmlr.org/papers/volume9/vandermaaten08a/vandermaaten08a.pdf) by Laurens van der Maaten & Geoffrey Hinton. We will first start with implementing algorithm 1 below step-by-step, which will cover 95% of the main algorithm. There are two additional enhancements the authors note: 1) Early Exaggeration & 2) Adaptive Learning Rates. We will only discuss adding in the early exaggeration as that is most conducive in aiding the interpretation of the actual algorithms inner workings, as the adaptive learning rate is focused on improving the rates of convergence."

We will set $\\eta=200$ for our example and will fix $\\alpha(t)=0.5$ if $t < 250$ and $\\alpha(t)=0.8$ otherwise. We have all the components necessary above to compute to the update rule, thus we can now run our optimization over a set number of iterations $T$ (we will set $T=1000$).\n",

What this does is it places more emphasis on modeling the very similar points (high values in $p_{ij}$ from the original space) in the new space early on and thus forming “clusters” of highly similar points. The early exaggeration is placed on at the beginning of the iteration scheme ($T<250$) and then turned off otherwise. Early exaggeration will be set to 4 in our case.

    "\n",
    "And there you have it, we have coded t-SNE from scratch! I hope you have found this exercise to be illuminating into the inner workings of t-SNE and, at the very minimum, satisfying. Note that this implementation is not intended to be optimized for speed, but rather for understanding. Additions to the t-SNE algorithm have been implemented to improve computational speed and performance, such as variants of the [Barnes-Hut algorithm](https://lvdmaaten.github.io/publications/papers/JMLR_2014.pdf) (tree-based approaches), using PCA as the initialization of the embedding, or using additional gradient descent extensions such as adaptive learning rates. The implementation in scikit-learn makes use of many of these enhancements.\n",
